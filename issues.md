# Broken App Issues
1. Used var when defining the express app, changed to const

2. developers is undefined (TypeError) when working with axios data.

3. Missing app.use(express.json()); - caused devleopers to be undefined

3. return res.send(JSON.stringify(out)); (not sure if I'm right) it seems returning res.json would be better. 

4. Name is undefined because developers is undefined. \

5. Did not pass err into catch()
